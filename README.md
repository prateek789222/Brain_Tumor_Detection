# BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION

A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. Brain tumors can be either cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Malignant brain tumors can spread to other parts of the body, while benign brain tumors do not.

The symptoms of a brain tumor vary depending on the tumor's size, location, and type. Common symptoms include:

Headaches
Seizures
Nausea and vomiting
Weakness or numbness on one side of the body
Vision problems
Speech problems
Personality changes
Difficulty thinking or concentrating
The diagnosis of a brain tumor is made through a combination of tests, including:

MRI scan
CT scan
PET scan
Biopsy
The treatment for a brain tumor depends on the tumor's type, size, location, and patient's age and overall health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments.

The folder contains MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders.
Each folder has more four subfolders. These folders have MRIs of respective tumor classes.

# TRAINING 
The model was trained using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Logistic Regression.
